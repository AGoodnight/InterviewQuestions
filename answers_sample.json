            "answer": "In a previous role at [Previous Company Name], I was managing multiple marketing campaigns simultaneously, and I unfortunately overcommitted my time, leading to a missed deadline for the final report on one of the smaller campaigns. Initially, I felt frustrated and disappointed in myself. However, I immediately took several steps. First, I proactively communicated the delay to my direct supervisor and the relevant team members as soon as I realized I wouldn't meet the deadline, explaining the reasons honestly and taking full responsibility. I then reprioritized my tasks, focusing on completing the delayed report efficiently without sacrificing quality. I also analyzed what had led to the situation â€“ in this case, a lack of proactive time management and underestimation of the workload across all projects. To prevent this from happening again, I implemented a more rigorous personal time management system, including detailed task breakdown and buffer time allocation, and I became more diligent in communicating potential roadblocks earlier in the process. While it was a setback, it was a valuable learning experience that significantly improved my organizational and time management skills.",
